# AtomHacks X website

Here's the source code for the [AtomHacks X](https://atomhacks.org) website. It was written by the programming department with @frykher being the Head.

We used a variety of frameworks and libraries. The website was written in TypeScript, utilizing React and Next.js as the framework (making it easy for us to deploy on Vercel). For the account system, we utilized Auth.js. To make styling easier, we used TailwindCSS. There were a bunch of other libraries that we used for animation, icons, and widgets as well.

Most of the team that worked on this (@frykher, @wd7bxscience) will be graduating Bronx Science in 2024, so this is our last time working at AtomHacks. Thank you for all the fun, and good luck next year!

PS: Yes, @frykher decided we should have our development .env in this repo. We've reset the tokens and urls already, if you're wondering.
